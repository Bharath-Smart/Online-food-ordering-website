# Details
1. INTRO SECTION

a. Top Navigation Bar:
1) There is a top Navigation Bar which will redirect you to the different sections of the page. And when a link is clicked it will scroll smoothly to the section.
2) The navbar is fixed and will be at the same position even after scrolling the page. And it contains a logo of the restaurant.

b. Intro Page
1) The main intro Page is divided into two sections vertically (using flexbox). One side it has the cover page for the restaurant and the other has the name of the restaurant with a subtitle and a caption about restaurant.
2) It also has a button below the title to redirect to the Specialities section (Button can be check our specialities).

2. SPECIALITIES SECTION

1) This specialities section also has a title along with subtitle.
2) This section contains cards to show the special dishes.
3) The card has an image of the dish, a title, and also a sign showing if the dish is veg or non-veg (on the corner of the card). And below the title of the dish, there will be discount and a short description of the dish.
4) On the bottom right corner, there is price of the dish and these cards have some cool hover effects.
5) Beside the title, there is button saying "Add+" which will not work now (as there is no JS involved) but it only change its appearance to "Added (in green color)", used class name: focus to implement this.

3. RECOMMENDATIONS SECTION

1) This section again contain the dish cards but some more cards in this section.
2) This section is similar to the specialities section with the only added idea that I have added a search bar on the top of this section below the title and subtitle.
3) This search bar have a simple magnify icon and one will be able to type anything on the bar.
